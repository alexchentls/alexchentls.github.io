During the winter break, I returned to my internship at Sunyard, where I led the second development phase of the AI-powered enterprise loan application system. To enhance the model's performance in handling complex business scenarios, I curated a high-quality training dataset from diverse Q&A corpora and improved the model’s semantic matching accuracy by 30% through iterative training. Moreover, to improve depth and accuracy of automated reports and risk assessment, I implemented cross-join techniques to parse business registration data and map upstream-downstream industry relationships. These enhancements significantly increased the efficiency of banks’ enterprise lending processes.

Beyond internship, I remained actively engaged in various volunteer & extracurricular initiatives. Through Link Crew and Quarantine-Learning Tutoring, I provided academic support and mentorship to help high-schoolers navigate their coursework and adjust to campus life. Meanwhile, as co-president of the Stand-up Comedy Club, I helped create a vibrant comedy culture on campus through open-mic and stand-up tutorials. In parallel, I continued leading Tracks and Lines, our dedicated translation group. After translating several music documentaries, we hosted our second screening party in Hangzhou, China to bring together local music enthusiasts and foster appreciation for western music culture in the region. I aspire to contribute my enthusiasm to CMU’s volunteer services while enriching CMU’s comedy and music culture.

My passion for Heinz College has only grown as I’ve delved deeper into its programs. The Digital Transformation and Innovation Center fascinates me with its projects in tackling securities and technical challenges on AI practices, which perfectly aligns with my goal of fostering safer and more efficient integration of AI to real-world industries. Moreover, TCinGC resonates strongly with my desire to apply technical skills to real-world challenges on a global scale. It offers an ideal opportunity to sharpen my problem-solving and collaboration skills while creating meaningful impact through technology-driven solutions.
