The phrase “mental health and fishing” comes from a series of games I used to play by the Rusty Lake Studio. I believed it first appeared in the Cupe Escape: Seasons, but I could be wrong. Anyway, just search the phrase along with “rusty lake” and you’ll see what it looks like. I’m too lazy to insert any picture here.

Well the thing is, at this very moment of June, 2025, I feel like my germophobia might be as strong as ever, at least behaviorally if not psychologically, along with the company of OCD. 
I won’t say I feel the same long-lasting anxiety anymore, but I’m still combating with it at the very moment and struggling to improve my redundant behaviors. One cannot take showering and using restroom as a burden can he.

About a year has passed since I arrived in Hangzhou, China, which sort of marked the beginning of taking germophobia as a serious thing. And right now, whenever I feeled too stressed or overwhelmed by my fucking OCD and all that, this phrase popped up in my mind – “mental health and fishing”.

My grandpa (on my mother’s side) is a fishing lover and one of my dearest people in childhood. I can’t remember when was the last time he actually fished, but he played a small, simple fishing game on his iPhone by my side in the summer vacation of 2017.

Anyway, I’ll constantly update some phrases here that might help with my mental stability. Feel free to check them if you like.
